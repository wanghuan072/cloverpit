      <h2>Are You Tired of the Same Old Interest Flow?</h2>
      <p>Are you tired of the monotonous interest flow builds in <strong>CloverPit</strong>? While it's stable and powerful, in the late game, the ever-increasing debt makes interest growth feel insufficient. Don't worry! This guide will introduce you to several equally powerful, even more explosive alternative builds that will take your gameplay experience to the next level!</p>

      <h2>1. Token Loop Build: The Perpetual Wealth Engine</h2>
      <p>This is widely considered one of the most stable infinite builds in the game. The core concept is using <strong>Tickets</strong> to infinitely refresh the shop and convert excess tickets into cash through specific items, creating a perpetual wealth engine.</p>
      
      <h3>Core Items:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Golden Cherry/Golden Lemon + Shoes/Wheelbarrow:</strong> This is the starter for the token loop. Golden fruits dramatically increase the chance of corresponding fruits appearing, while shoes/wheelbarrow convert these fruits into tickets.</li>
        <li><strong>Clover Pot:</strong> Collects 30% of existing tickets at each deadline, ensuring your ticket supply never runs dry. When you've accumulated enough tickets, you can even sell the pot since you have sufficient tickets to sustain your loop.</li>
        <li><strong>Cigarettes:</strong> Allow you to refresh the shop for free using tickets. This is the core method for infinite refreshing to find other key items and briefcases.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How It Works:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Early game: Quickly obtain golden fruits and shoes/wheelbarrow to accumulate enough tickets.</li>
        <li>When you have sufficient tickets, use cigarettes to infinitely refresh the shop, looking for briefcases to handle deadlines.</li>
        <li>Use the Clover Pot to recover tickets at each deadline while continuing to refresh the shop with cigarettes and purchase briefcases, creating a perpetual cycle.</li>
        <li>Further optimize ticket conversion efficiency and shop refresh effects through ATM and Electrician items.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>2. Gambler Build: High Risk, High Reward Thrills</h2>
      <p>If you love adventure and seek ultimate thrills, the Gambler build is perfect for you. This build relies on various items that can influence gambling outcomes, pursuing massive returns through high-risk gambling.</p>

      <h3>Core Items:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Charms:</strong> Use various charms to turn the tide and avoid unfavorable outcomes. For example, charms can provide extra luck to help you overcome critical moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Bible/Evil Deal:</strong> These items can change random events in the game. Use the Bible to avoid negative events (like "666"), and Evil Deal to trigger high-risk, high-reward events.</li>
        <li><strong>Lucky Horseshoe/Fake Coin/D4:</strong> Increase luck values, boosting the chance of critical hits and high-reward events, but also bringing higher risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How It Works:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with the token loop build to quickly accumulate resources.</li>
        <li>Begin collecting gambler items like charms and Bible in the mid-game.</li>
        <li>Once your gambler build is complete, you can gamble more aggressively, pursuing single high-yield spins to rapidly surpass exponentially growing debt.</li>
        <li>This requires some luck and deep understanding of game mechanics, but the rewards are astonishing once successful.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>3. Merchant Build: The Steady Debt Liquidator</h2>
      <p>The Merchant build is a steady strategy that relies entirely on shop mechanics for funding, requiring almost no dependence on gambling or interest.</p>

      <h3>Core Items:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Briefcase:</strong> The core item of the merchant build. Briefcases provide 30% of current deadline debt funding, and their value grows infinitely with debt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cigarettes:</strong> Use tickets to infinitely refresh the shop, looking for briefcases.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrician/ATM:</strong> Electrician can reset items, while ATM can increase ticket rewards, further optimizing your shop cycle.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How It Works:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with the token loop build to accumulate large amounts of tickets.</li>
        <li>Use cigarettes to infinitely refresh the shop, purchasing large quantities of briefcases.</li>
        <li>At deadline time, use briefcases to directly pay off most of your debt.</li>
        <li>This strategy is very stable - as long as you have enough tickets and cigarettes, you can infinitely repeat this process, easily handling increasingly high debt.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>4. 7s Build: One-Shot Kill Explosive Power</h2>
      <p>This is a build focused on specific symbols, aiming to dramatically increase the appearance rate and value of <strong>"7s"</strong> symbols through specific items, achieving massive single-spin returns.</p>

      <h3>Core Items:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone/Specific Charms:</strong> Use phone calls or charms to increase the weight of "7s" symbols.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuclear Button/D4:</strong> Nuclear Button can repeatedly trigger effects, D4 can increase randomness - combining both greatly enhances "7s" trigger rate and rewards.</li>
        <li><strong>Pentagram:</strong> Increases symbol multipliers, taking "7s" rewards to the next level.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How It Works:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Early game: Accumulate funds through golden fruits or token loops.</li>
        <li>Mid-game: Start collecting "7s"-related items and use phone calls to boost "7s" weight.</li>
        <li>Late game: Use Nuclear Button, Pentagram, and other items to achieve massive "7s" bursts, paying off all debt in one shot, even gaining infinite rewards.</li>
        <li>This build is high-risk, depending on specific item combinations and some luck, but once complete, the explosive power is incredible.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Conclusion: Find Your Perfect Path to Wealth</h2>
      <p>The charm of <strong>CloverPit</strong> lies in its diverse build possibilities. Beyond relying on stable interest growth, you can choose the steadiness of token loops, the thrill of gambler builds, the comfort of merchant strategies, or the explosive power of "7s" builds. Each strategy offers unique fun and challenges.</p>
      
      <p>We hope this guide provides you with new ideas to help you find the wealth-building path that suits you best, ultimately escaping this damn gambling hell!</p>
